                    <p class="lead my-3">Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cal, welcome to my website.</p>
                    <p class="lead my-3">I built this as a chance to practice my web development skills. I'm enjoying the challenging of making added improvements, so I thought I'd use this as a space not only to give a professional summary of myself, but also somewhere to showcase side projects and write blogs (writing's not really my fortÃ© but I'm a man of many opinions).</p>
                    <p class="lead my-3">I'm 28 years old, based in Melbourne AU. As a trained statistician, I discovered a career in data & analytics a few years back and have been doing so ever since. In my free time I enjoy learning new skills, playing/watching sports (particularly tennis, soccer and cricket), running, meditation, playing guitar and cooking vegetarian dishes. As you may have noticed on the <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">home page</a>, I have an interest in Stoic philosophy; wrtings of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius are among some of my favourites and have helped me through some tough phases.</p>
                    <p class="lead my-3">I'm also part of a wonderful family, me being the eldest of four. Shout out to Mum, Dad, Amz, Lukey and Lil for being the absolute best. Love you all ðŸ˜˜</p>
